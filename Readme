### pip install google-auth google-auth-oauthlib google-auth-httplib2 google-api-python-client

It is one of the useless thing but im trying to show that hit map.

## Download all requirements 
## you got to get the json file through cloud.google.com
## enable the google drive api add OAuth credentials and you will get the json file and to the python script.




The main purpose of this repo is to download the drive file i think it only downloads the pdf i am not sure ! 

Happy Coding !!!
